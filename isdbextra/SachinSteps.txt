1) get hosting plan (theyll provide a database), if not then look for a free database provider to get one setup - done
2) create one table - done
3) make some fields in that table (customer_id, customer_name, customer_image_url)
4) populate it with dummy data but real images (of whatever the fuck u want) so u know it works

5) connect that database to ur website using php

6) pull in information from that database (SELECT * FROM users_table WHERE user_id IS 1) something like that
7) then display the customer_image_url in an <image> tag
